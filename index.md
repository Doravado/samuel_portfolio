Welcome to my portfolio page! Here are the projects I did or am doing.

# üéÆPlaystudios Loyalty Program Engagement Model (In Progress)

- Led a team of four to drive project progress and was mainly responsible for communicating with clients and other parties to coordinate tasks and timelines.

- Collaborated with teammates to build project methodology. Used snowflake and python to process millions of player data, including querying and cleaning data and creating model variables.

- Used machine learning to do player segmentation and classification. Did survival analysis and built a retention model to identify early characteristics of loyal players.

- Based on insights from player analysis and models, our team is now designing the marketing campaign to activate potential loyalty players with highly efficient campaign methods.

- For the client's confidentiality policy, I can't display specific data here, and I am happy to share our team's work plan and thought process in a conversation.

# üöÄSpaceY Successful Landing Prediction

- Collected data from public SpaceX API and SpaceX Wikipedia page. Cleaned data and gathered relevant columns to be used as features to predict successful landings.

- Explored data using SQL, visualization, folium maps, and [dashboard](https://space-y-dashboard.onrender.com/). Explored and visualized the correlation between successful landings and other features.

- Four machine learning models were produced: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree Classifier, and K Nearest Neighbors to predict successful landings.

- Used GridSearchCV to find the best parameters for machine learning models. All models had similar results, with an accuracy rate of about 83.33%.

# üõ¨USA Airline Delay Cause Analysis

- Cleaned the data of USA airline delay cause (data source: [Federal Aviation Administration](https://www.faa.gov/data_research)). Handled missing values, merged date time, and delimited geographic information.

- Analyzed and visualized the data from multiple perspectives and generated insights on time series features, delay cause, and geographic information.

- Used Holt-Winters model and forecasted Austin Airport performance in 2023. Created and deployed the performance [dashboard](https://austin-ariport-delay-cause-dashboard.onrender.com) (click to see).

- In Oct 2022, I presented insights on choosing the least-likely-delayed airlines during the 2022 Thanksgiving holiday to classmates at UT Austin. I got some positive feedback about the accuracy of my models and insights after the holiday.

# üë§iFood Customer Data EDA

- Created a new column as the unique identifier. Made a boxplot for each column and removed the outlier data. Visualized each column‚Äôs data distribution with histograms.

- Used cluster map, catplot, regplot to visualize the correlation between variables. Picked the optimal X variables to predict customer response, based on random forest results.

- Fitted the train data into three models (logit, probit, and c-log-log). Probit regression may be the best model for the data, with 87% accuracy after optimization.

- Plotted a histogram of response probability. The business can use the model to target customers who are more likely to respond and save more marketing costs.

# üè¢2022-2023 Layoffs Data Visualization
- Cleaned the data (data source: Layoffs.fyi) with Excel. Visualized the layoffs data from multiple perspectives (including by country, by industry, by company)  to show the distribution and timeline of the mass layoffs. Deployed the dashboard on Tableau Public.
