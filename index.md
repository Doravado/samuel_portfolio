# üéÆPlaystudios Loyalty Program Engagement Model (In Progress)
- Led a team of four to drive project progress and was mainly responsible for communicating with clients and other parties to coordinate tasks and timelines.

- Collaborated with teammates to build project methodology. Used snowflake and python to process 2 million player data, including querying and cleaning data and creating model variables.

- Used machine learning to do player segmentation and classification. Did survival analysis and built a retention model to identify early characteristics of loyal players.

- Based on insights from player analysis and models, our team is now designing a marketing campaign to activate potential loyalty players with highly efficient campaign methods.

# üöÄSpaceY Successful Landing Prediction
- Collected data from public SpaceX API and SpaceX Wikipedia page. Cleaned data and gathered relevant columns to be used as features to predict successful landings.

- Explored data using SQL, visualization, folium maps, and [dashboard](https://space-y-dashboard.onrender.com/). Explored and visualized the correlation between successful landings and other features.

- 4 machine learning models were produced: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree Classifier, and K Nearest Neighbors to predict successful landings.

- Used GridSearchCV to find the best parameters for machine learning models. All models had similar results, with an accuracy rate of about 83.33%.

# üõ¨USA Airline Delay Cause Analysis
- Cleaned the data of USA airline delay cause (data source: [Federal Aviation Administration](https://www.faa.gov/data_research)). Handled missing values, merged date time, and delimited geographic information.

- Analyzed and visualized the data from multiple perspectives and generated insights on time series features, delay cause, and geographic information.

- Used Holt-Winters model and forecasted Austin Airport performance in 2023. Created and deployed the performance [dashboard](https://austin-ariport-delay-cause-dashboard.onrender.com) (click to see).

- In Oct 2022, I presented insights on choosing the least-likely-delayed airlines during the 2022 Thanksgiving holiday to classmates at UT Austin. I got some positive feedback about the accuracy of my models and insights after the holiday.

# üë§iFood Customer Data EDA
- Created a new column as the unique identifier. Made a boxplot for each column and removed the outlier data. Visualized each column‚Äôs data distribution with histograms.

- Used cluster map, catplot, regplot to visualize the correlation between variables. Picked the optimal X variables to predict customer response, based on random forest results.

- Fitted the train data into three models (logit, probit, and c-log-log). Probit regression may be the best model for the data, with 87% accuracy after optimization.

- Plotted a histogram of response probability. The business can use the model to target customers who are more likely to respond and save more marketing costs.

# üè¢2022-2023 Layoffs Data Visualization
- Cleaned the data (data source: [Layoffs.fyi](https://layoffs.fyi/)) with Excel. 

- Visualized the data from multiple perspectives (including by country, by industry, by company) to show the distribution and timeline of the mass layoffs.

- Deployed the dashboard on Tableau Public.
