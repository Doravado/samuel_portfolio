Welcome to my portfolio page! Here are the projects I did or am doing.

# Project 1: USA Airline Delay Cause

- Cleaned the data of USA airline delay cause (data source: [Federal Aviation Administration](https://www.faa.gov/data_research)). Handled missing values, merged date time, and delimited geographic information.

- Analyzed and visualized the data from multiple perspectives and generated insights on time series features, delay cause, and geographic information.
- Used Holt-Winters model and forecasted Austin Airport performance in 2023. Created and deployed the performance [report](https://austin-ariport-delay-cause-dashboard.onrender.com) (click to see the dashboard).

- In Oct 2022, I presented insights on choosing the least-likely-delayed airlines during the 2022 Thanksgiving holiday to classmates at UT Austin. I got some positive feedback about the accuracy of my models and insights after the holiday.
