# üéÆPlaystudios Loyalty Program Engagement Model (In Progress)
- Led a team of four to drive project progress and was mainly responsible for communicating with clients and other parties to coordinate tasks and timelines.

- Collaborated with teammates to build project methodology. Used snowflake, SQL, and python to process 2 million player data independently, including querying and cleaning data and creating model variables.

- Used machine learning to do player segmentation and classification. Did survival analysis and built a retention model to identify early characteristics of loyal players.

- Based on insights from player analysis and models, our team is now designing a marketing campaign to activate potential loyalty players with highly efficient campaign methods.

- Made decks and communicated project methodology and outcomes to client, synthesizing technical analysis into simple and clear terms.

# üèÖMcCombs Marketing Case Challenge of SAMSUNG
- Won the 3rd place against MSM and MBA teams in case competition judged by Fortune 500 executives.

- Collaborated with teammates and recommended a blue ocean strategy for SAMSUNG to gain Gen Z customers in the U.S. by utilizing 3+ marketing models and qualitative research.

- Responsible for qualitative analysis of customer segmentation, media strategy, campaign effect, and budget recommendation.

- Presented the final strategy and marketing campaign plan to judges with teammates. Answered judges' questions and communicated strategy thought processes.

### Key Insights
- Target Segment: Based on our analysis, within Gen Z Girls, the Gen Z Girl Gamer has the highest potential and alignment with SAMSUNG's product portfolio.

- Emerging Market: Almost all Gen Z Girls already have a phone. So, to break into the market, targeting wireless audio is the most ideal because it is an emerging market.

- Current Positioning: We noticed a potential new market of wireless audio for gaming with no other major competitors for SAMSUNG Galaxy Buds.

- Proposed Campaign: We propose a campaign called #AllYou based on Gen Z‚Äôs psychographics. This campaign will build empathy with consumers through sponsored streams of influencers.

- Break Into Niche & Conquer: We can decrease customers‚Äô switching costs by using earbuds as a stepping stone to build brand equity. Ultimately, we can get Gen Z switch to the whole SAMSUNG‚Äôs product portfolio.

# üõ¨USA Airline Delay Cause Analysis
- Cleaned the data of USA airline delay cause (data source: [Federal Aviation Administration](https://www.faa.gov/data_research)). Handled missing values, merged date time, and delimited geographic information in python.

- Analyzed and visualized the data from multiple perspectives and generated insights on time series features, delay cause, and geographic information.

- Used Holt-Winters model and forecasted Austin Airport performance in 2023. Optimized the models and increased the accuracy by 5% on average. Created and deployed the performance [dashboard](https://austin-ariport-delay-cause-dashboard.onrender.com) (click to see).

- In Oct 2022, I presented insights on choosing the least-likely-delayed airlines at Austin Airport during the 2022 Thanksgiving holiday in class. After holiday, my classmates gave me some positive feedback about the accuracy of the models according to their holiday travel experience.

# üöÄSpaceY Successful Landing Prediction
- Collected data from public SpaceX API and SpaceX Wikipedia page. Cleaned data and gathered relevant columns to be used as features to predict successful landings.

- Explored data using SQL, visualization, folium maps, and [dashboard](https://space-y-dashboard.onrender.com/). Explored and visualized the correlation between successful landings and other features.

- 4 machine learning models were produced: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree Classifier, and K Nearest Neighbors to predict successful landings.

- Used GridSearchCV to find the best parameters for machine learning models. All models had similar results, with an accuracy rate of about 83.33%.

### Key Insights
- 20 flights is a significant breakthrough that increased the landing success rate.

- Landing appears to perform better in lower orbits or Sun-synchronous orbits.

- Landing success generally increases over time since 2013, with a slight dip in 2018. Success in recent years at around 80%.

![](image/spacey/launchtime.png){: width="50%" }

- All models had virtually the same accuracy on the test set at 83.33% accuracy. We likely need more data to determine the best model.
- SpaceY can use this model to predict whether a launch will have a successful landing to determine whether the launch should be made or not.

# üë§iFood Customer Data EDA
- Created a new column as the unique identifier. Made a boxplot for each column and removed the outlier data. Visualized each column‚Äôs data distribution with histograms.

- Used cluster map, catplot, regplot to visualize the correlation between variables. Picked the optimal X variables to predict customer response, based on random forest results.

- Fitted the train data into three models (logit, probit, and c-log-log). Probit regression may be the best model for the data, with 87% accuracy after optimization.

- Plotted a histogram of response probability. The business can use the model to target customers who are more likely to respond and save more marketing costs.

# üè¢2022-2023 Layoffs Data Visualization
- Cleaned the data (data source: [Layoffs.fyi](https://layoffs.fyi/)) with Excel. 

- Visualized the data from multiple perspectives (including by country, by industry, by company) to show the distribution and timeline of the mass layoffs.

- Deployed the dashboard on Tableau Public.
